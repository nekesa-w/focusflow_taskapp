# ADHD Task Management Application

A web-based task management app designed to assist users, particularly those with ADHD, by breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable steps. The app integrates a **smollm2-135M-instruct** model, which uses AI to help users deconstruct complex tasks into more digestible sub-tasks.

## Features

- **Task Breakdown**: Automatically breaks down complex tasks into smaller, actionable sub-tasks using the **smollm2-135M-instruct** AI model.
- **Task Creation and Management**: Easily create tasks and assign due dates and priorities. Keep track of progress and mark tasks as complete.
- **Subtask Organization**: Tasks are divided into subtasks, allowing users to focus on one small step at a time.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration using token-based authentication.
- **Intuitive User Interface**: Clean, responsive design built with **React** and **Material UI**, ensuring a pleasant user experience.

## Technologies Used

### **Frontend**:
- **React 18.3.1** with **Vite 6.0.6**: For fast, modern front-end development.
- **Material UI 6.3.0**: For ready-to-use UI components following Google’s Material Design principles.
- **React Router DOM 7.1.1**: To manage client-side routing for smooth page navigation.
- **Axios 1.7.9**: To make HTTP requests to the backend.
- **CORS 4.6.0**: For handling cross-origin requests between the frontend and backend.

### **Backend**:
- **Django 5.1.4**: Web framework used for creating the backend API.
- **Django REST Framework 3.15**: For building RESTful APIs.
- **Knox 5.0.2**: Token-based authentication system for secure login.
- **MariaDB 1.4.4**: Relational database for storing user and task data.

### **Machine Learning**:
- **smollm2-135M-instruct**: The AI model used for breaking down tasks into smaller, actionable sub-tasks based on user input.
